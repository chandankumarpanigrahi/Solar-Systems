## Getting Started

Unfortunately, there's no `package.json` file, so standard JavaScript project installation instructions don't apply.  Based on the file structure, this project appears to be a PHP-based website with some JavaScript elements.

**Prerequisites:**

*   A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
*   PHP installed and configured
*   A code editor

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  Place the project files in your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/`).

3.  Configure your web server to serve the `index.php` file.

4.  Access the website through your web browser.

## Key Features

Based on the file names, the project likely includes:

*   **Dynamic Content:**  `index.php`, `footer.php`, `header.php`, and `sample.php` suggest dynamic content generation using PHP.
*   **Assets:** The `assets` directory likely contains images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
*   **Potential for Interactive Elements:**  Given the project name and the use of JavaScript, there might be interactive elements related to solar systems.
